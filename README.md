# # Higher or Lower Game

This project is a simple console-based "Higher or Lower" game where players guess which celebrity or entity has more Instagram followers. The game provides two options, and the player must choose the one they believe has a higher follower count. The player's score increases with each correct guess, and the game ends when the player makes a wrong guess.
